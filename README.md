## Configuring NAT network to connect 2 VM

I am setting up my lab enviornment to use for malware analysis, penetration testing, and secure software testing.üåê

### Tools Used:

- VirtualBox Installer
- Kali Linux OVA file
- Windows ISO file

### What I Did

In this lab i set up my virtual enviornment using Virtual Box.(My Favorite). You can use other virtual Machines like VMware and Microsoft Hyper-V Manager aswell.

Then I had to change the network to NAT network so the vms can reach each other
